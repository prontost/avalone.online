"""Meta-descriptions for every glossary key.

The goal: any key, even without a hand-written description, carries enough
context for an AI/human translator to produce a correct translation.

Rules are applied EXACT -> PREFIX -> GENERIC. Domain-specific prefixes
(currencies, categories, tips) are described explicitly so that generic
finance/work vocabulary does not end up ambiguous.
